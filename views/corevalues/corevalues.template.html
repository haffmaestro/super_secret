##No small dreams
__Criteria:__ Am I making a positive difference on the world? How can I do this better?

__Tenets:__ We know that progress is not made by doing what has already been done, but by forgetting what is considered possible

Our goals are enormous. Weâ€™re revolutionizing the workplace, and we know that takes tremendous imagination, tenacity, collaboration, humility, and a healthy dissatisfaction with the status quo
We help each other build dreams into reality

__Go big, or go bigger. Your imagination is your only limit, and your team is your greatest gift.__

##Ownership
__Criteria:__ Am I acting with the goals of the team in mind? Am I engaging with my work as though it were for myself?

__Tenets:__ We understand that trust and autonomy are essential to building a strong culture. We hire exceptional people, give them the resources they need, and show them the high-level impact of their actions.
We take responsibility for our mistakes.
We encourage people to share their opinions and create a safe space for honest feedback.

__Actions reverberate. Own them, and be the kind of person who would inspire you.__
